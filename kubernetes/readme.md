## Kubernetes
### What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, management, and operation of containerized applications. It is a container orchestration tool that helps developers and IT teams efficiently manage the lifecycle of containers, which are lightweight, portable units of software that package applications and their dependencies.
